# Day 4 HW

In class, you have created a program (or should try to do so now). That when you press a button there is a signal sent to the PICO that tells the PICO to light the LED, and when the
button is released to turn the LED off.

## Homework

Modify the LED-Button program so the LED blinks twice when the button is pressed. This is somewhat different logic. When the button is pressed the LED will blink twice, and then 
turn off. What should happen if the button is held? There are two options: easy and hard.

### Easy version

When the button is held the light continues to flash, on/off.

### Hard version

When the button is held it flashes twice and then won't flash again until the button is released.
